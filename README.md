## Regex Pattern
In this section, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of the featured regex pattern and how it works.

## Character Classes
Character classes are a crucial part of regular expressions. We will explain what they are and how to use them effectively.

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers in regex allow you to specify how many times a character or group should be repeated. Learn how to leverage quantifiers in your regex patterns.

## Anchors
Anchors are used to specify where in the text the regex pattern should match. We will dive into how anchors work and when to use them.

## Groups
Regular expression groups help you organize and capture parts of your matches. We will explore the power of grouping in regex.

## Special Characters
Special characters, such as the dot (.), are used in regex to match specific characters. Learn how to use these special characters effectively.
